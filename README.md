# Quiz_App
Summary:
Quiz app is a simple test game which shows a flag of one country and user have to choose correct answer between four variant. 
After user has selected one variant and click "submit" button, app shows which variant is correct and change it color to green but if user chose wrong answer
then that variant would be in red color. At the end when user answered to 10 questions and click "finish" button, Result layout will appear and show how many answer were correct out of 10.

All questions I have added manually in one class.
